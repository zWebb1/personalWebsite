        </p>
        <p class="text">
            C:\Zachary\Webb> I am Zach. I am currently a senior in computer science at the University of South Carolina
            and expect to
            graduate in May of 2023.
            Born and raised in Charlotte, North Carolina, I am passionate about computers, spending time with family and
            hanging out with friends. Some of my hobbies
            are snowboarding, fishing, and weight lifting. I love getting to know people and hope we have the chance to
            connect soon!
