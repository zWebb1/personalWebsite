            C:\Zachary\Webb\StudyVerse> StudiVerse is a mobile app designed to assist college students in locating
            groups
            and tutors for subjects in which they require assistance. The app strives to get users/students into the app
            as quickly as possible, and upon signing up, our matchmaking system promptly connects them with potential
            tutors and fellow students interested in forming study groups to support one another. StudiVerse enables
            users to communicate with each other via an in-house messaging system.
