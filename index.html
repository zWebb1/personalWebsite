            C:\Zachary\Webb\StudiVerse> StudiVerse is a mobile app designed to assist college students in locating
            groups
            and tutors for subjects in which they require assistance. The app strives to get users/students into the app
            as quickly as possible, and upon signing up, our matchmaking system promptly connects them with potential
            tutors and fellow students interested in forming study groups to support one another. StudiVerse enables
            users to communicate with each other via an in-house messaging system for groups or just one to one talk.

            C:\Zachary\Webb\SearchNear> "Search Near" is an app made in Android Studio using Kotlin. This was a final project
            made for mobile application development. We used Google's API call "Search for nearby places" to help users find 
            nearby restaurants, grocery stores, and gas stations. The first thing the users see is a dark mode screen with an option
            to switch to light mode if they choose. They are presented the three searching options and can specify the radius within
            which they would like to search. Once they click on the search button, the app takes their location and the parameters
            they entered and navigates to a different screen, which is a map that displays their current location along with all the 
            locations of the selected industries. The app also includes a back button that allows users to go back and perform a new search.
